Supporting information for running the Docker tutorial with Vagrant

There's a great tutorial for getting started with Docker
https://docs.docker.com/get-started/

The problem is that if your are not running a platform that can use the docker-machine commands it gets a bit messy.
I therefore decided to adapt a few bits and learn using Vagrant to build my swarm boxes.
Most of the tutorial is still good: the only bits to work around are those in which you will need to get onto the "master" Vagrant box.
